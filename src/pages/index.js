    <h1>Front End Developer</h1>
    <h2>Located in Melbourne & passionate about all things web!</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to building websites or building any form of web
      application, I take a carefully planned approach ensuring that all facets
      are developed with diligence. Aspects such as browser compatibility,
      rigorous testing, code quality and performance standards are all important
      to me.

      Below are some of the projects I have worked on as the primary developer
      both at Chromatix Digital Agency and other freelance work. International
      Internships was one of my biggest achievements last year as it took out
      the 2016 National Winner in Education at the Australian Web Awards.
